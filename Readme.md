####SniptNet#

SniptNet is a C# application which is used to access snipts from [snipt.net](snipt.net).

SniptNet fetches private and public snipts from private snipt account.
At present it only fetches 30 snipts.

To get snipts Username, UserId and APIKey had to be provided in App.config.

As of now the snipts are saved in "SniptsFiles" in D:\\ directory.

#####Future enhancements#

* Make directory configurable
* Make snipt imit count configuration
* Facilitate move snipt directly from [snipt.net](snipt.net) to services like [Gist](gist.github.com) etc.
